Whether we repurpose our waste through recycling, or “get rid” by burying or burning these by-products, our choices can have a big impact on the environment. In the United States, landfills are the third largest source of methane gas. Methane is 34 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere - it\'s a really potent greenhouse gas. If you want to help combat the effect of climate change, then one easy step is to avoid the trash bin and try to reduce, reuse, or recycle.\\n\\nAlthough we should reduce how much waste we generate and reuse products whenever possible, sometimes this isn’t an option. Already, New Yorkers are producing less waste at home than ever before— and 68% of what we do throw away can be composted or belongs in curbside recycling. More than 40% of MGP––your metal, glass, plastic and carton recycling––collections consist of unwanted materials such as organic residues, paper, foam plastics, and film plastics like bags and wraps. If we are more careful about where we toss our waste, then we can ensure that more items are recycled and don’t end up buried or burned.\\n\\nDon’t forget how large this process is: before your waste is recycled, buried, or burned, it is transported, sorted, and processed by many human hands. The men and women of our Department are on the front lines every day working tirelessly to keep our city healthy, safe and clean. Following Your Waste on its journey from curbside pickup and through the inner workings of our city gives you a glimpse into the varied work that keeps New York City alive.","about_resources_title":"Are you an educator?","about_resources_body":"We’ve created a collection of supplementary materials and lesson plans to help bring the story of New York’s sanitation system to the classroom, no matter what age.","about_foundation_title":"About sanitation foundation"}],"items":[{"slug":"aluminum-foil","label":"Aluminum foil","tooltip":"Consider using reusable containers to store your food instead of aluminum foil."},{"slug":"broken-glass","label":"Broken glass","tooltip":"Double-bag broken glass to help protect you and your Sanitation Worker from injury."},{"slug":"cardboard","label":"Cardboard","tooltip":"Flatten your cardboard boxes to easily tie up or put in a bag-- don’t forget the small stuff like pasta and soap boxes!"},{"slug":"chip-bag","label":"Potato chip bag","tooltip":"This type of snack bag is usually made from different layers of materials, so they’re hard to recycle."},{"slug":"detergent-bottle","label":"Laundry detergent","tooltip":"Ignore the number on the bottle—NYC treats all rigid plastic the same way."},{"slug":"food-can","label":"Food can","tooltip":"These are made of steel or tin—not aluminum."},{"slug":"glass-bottles","label":"Glass bottle","tooltip":"Glass is heavy and increases shipping weights, so product designers are using other options for food packaging."},{"slug":"glass-jar","label":"Salsa glass jar","tooltip":"Consider reusing glass jars for snack, crafts, and small items."},{"slug":"milk-carton","label":"Milk carton","tooltip":"Cartons are the most commonly misplaced item because they contain layers of both paper and plastic."},{"slug":"newspaper","label":"Newspaper","tooltip":"Still getting your news the old-fashioned way?
